## Introduction

**TextUtils** is a powerful text manipulation platform built with React. It provides a suite of tools to help users perform common text-related tasks such as counting words and characters, converting text case, replacing words, removing extra spaces, and toggling between dark and light modes for a more comfortable user experience.

## Features

### Word & Character Counting

Easily count the number of words and characters in your text. This feature is perfect for writers, editors, and anyone who needs to manage text efficiently.

### Text Conversion

Convert your text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize the first letter of each word. This feature is useful for formatting text according to specific style guidelines.

### Word Replacement

Find and replace words in your text quickly and easily. This feature is helpful when you need to make bulk changes to specific words or phrases.

### Extra Space Removal

Automatically remove unnecessary spaces from your text with a single click, ensuring your text is clean and well-formatted.

### Dark/Light Mode

Toggle between dark and light themes for a comfortable reading and editing experience based on your preference. The selected theme is saved locally and applied on your next visit.

### User Interface Overview
1. **Main Layout**
Header: Contains the application title TextUtils prominently displayed, along with a navigation bar featuring links to different sections of the app (like usage instructions and contact info).
2. **Text Input Area**
Text Box: A large, editable text area where users can enter or paste their text. This area should be spacious for easy visibility and editing.
3. **Feature Buttons**
Below the text box, there are several buttons corresponding to the key features:
**Count Words & Characters**: A button that, when clicked, displays the count of words and characters in a prominent area.
**Convert Text**: Options (buttons or a dropdown) allowing users to choose between converting text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalizing each word.
**Replace Words**: A button that opens a small modal or dropdown for users to input the word they want to find and the word to replace it with.
**Remove Extra Spaces**: A simple button that, when clicked, cleans up the text in the text box.
4. **Theme Toggle**
**Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: A switch (often a toggle button) located in the navbar that allows users to switch between dark and light themes seamlessly. The current theme is visually indicated.
5. **Output Display**
Word/Character Count Display: A small area beneath the buttons to show the current word and character count dynamically as the user types.
6. **Responsive Design**
The layout adapts to different screen sizes:
Desktop: Wider text area and button layout.
Tablet and Mobile: Stacked layout for buttons and a more compact text area to maintain usability on smaller screens.
Additional Considerations
Color Scheme: Ensure that the color scheme is visually appealing and provides good contrast, especially between the dark and light modes.
Accessibility: Use labels and ARIA roles to make the application accessible to all users, including those using screen readers.
User Feedback: Consider adding subtle animations or alerts when an action is performed, like successfully removing spaces or changing modes.
